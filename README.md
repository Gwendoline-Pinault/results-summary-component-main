## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### Why I did this challenge

I'm doing a development formation to become a web developer. I wanted to check my new knowledge by doing this challenge.

I did most of the challenge fiew months ago, just after my courses. I finished it today by adding the media queries. A first, it wasn't so easy, but now I've improved my CSS skills ans flexboxes doesn't seems so complicated anymore.

Now, it's your turn to challenge you, good luck !
